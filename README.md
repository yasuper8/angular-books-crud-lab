# Angular Book App

### What are the objectives?
<!-- specific/measurable goal for students to achieve -->
*After this training, developers will be able to:*

- set up an angular app.
- use `$http` to access a RESTful API.
- practice routing in Angular using `ngRoute`.


Deliberate practice is a really effective way to build skills. You've learned about a lot of key pieces of an Angular app, and now it's time to put those pieces together.  You'll be expected to be able to build an Angular app from scratch.

### Overview 

In this lab, you'll be creating a simple library app to keep track of books.

When a user goes to `/`, they should see a list of all of the books in the API. When a user goes to `/books/:id`, they should see a single book. On the `/books/:id` page, a user should be able to edit or delete a book.

Your data (a list of books) is available at `https://super-crud.herokuapp.com/books`. You and your classmates will all be working with the shared API; keep that in mind as you make changes.  If there are no books left or far too many books, feel free to reset the database by clicking [the reset button](http://super-crud.herokuapp.com/reset). Don't do this without warning your colleagues, though. They might be puzzled why their newly created book resources aren't appearing in the database.

### Expectations

Your finished product will:

  1. Route the user to an index page at `/`. That page will:
    * display all of the books.
    * show the image, title, author, and release date of each book.
    * include a link to the show book page on the title of each book.
  2. Route the use to a show book page at `/books/:id` for any existing book id. The show page will:
    * display all of the data about the specific book.
    * have a delete button that deletes the specific book from the database and, when successfully deleted, redirects the user to the home page.
    * have an edit button that reveals a form for the user to edit the attributes of the book.
    * The form will have a save button that sends the edits to the database and, when successfully updated, redirects the user to the home page.
    * have a cancel button that does not save any of the changes the user just made.

### This Repo's Structure

There are two branches in this repo that you might want to pay attention to: `master` and `solutions`.

The `master` branch has these instructions, with no starter code.

The `solutions` branch has a fully built-out application that meets all the expectations above. Reference it if you're really stuck, but remember you may have your app set up differently!

**You can work directly from the `master` branch or create another branch for your work!**

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Change directories into `angular-books-crud-lab`.
3. Start creating the files you need for your project! (`index.html` and `app.js` are safe bets to start.)

### Tips

* Commit frequently!
* Once you add client-side routing,  Angular will need to be served from a server. Run `budo -P --host=localhost --open` from the Terminal (inside your project directory). This starts a simple server that by default will serve up your `index.html` on `/` and any route it doesn't recognize (like `/books`)!  Note: Your `index.html` *must* be in your main project directory for this server setup. 
* The books api is set up with RESTful routes, so follow RESTful routing conventions.  You can test endpoints with Postman or cURL, or by setting up a simple request to trigger them. 
* Look at (`console.log`) the data you get back from each `$http` request!

    Inject the [`$location`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$location) service, and use its `path` method.

### Stretch Challenges

2. **Allow the user to edit the book image:** allow the user to change the URL for the book image.
3. **Add filters to organize the books index page:** add a search bar to filter the books by your search, or buttons to sort them alphabetically by author name or book title.
